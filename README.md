## 🧩 My Process

The development process followed a structured and mobile-first approach:

1. ⚛️ **Component Setup** – Built reusable React components to structure the UI efficiently.
2. 🎨 **Styling** – Applied styles using **CSS Flexbox** for layout and **CSS custom properties** for consistent design.
3. 📱 **Responsive Design** – Implemented a **mobile-first** workflow, then used **media queries** to adjust the desktop
   layout.
4. 🧮 **Logic Implementation** – Integrated mortgage calculation logic and input validation.
